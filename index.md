This lesson introduces virtual machines and containers to a novice audience of librarians, subject specialists, and library staff with interest or work that intersects data management, data science, or research computing. The intent is breadth, rather than depth. Prior experience is not required but we assume some familiarity with basic computing concepts and with reproducible research. Those that need a refresher of the latter may consider reviewing the [Reproducible Research Workflows](https://ucla-imls-open-sci.info/reproducible-workflows/index.html) lesson.
