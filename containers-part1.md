:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions 

- What is a Docker image?
- What is a Docker container?
- How do you start and stop a container?
- How do retrieve output from a container to a local machine?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Explain the difference between a Docker image and a Docker container
- Retrieve a Docker image from the cloud
- Start a Docker container running on a local machine
- Use the command line to check the status of the container
- Clean the environment by stopping the container

## Introduction

**TODO**: images vs. containers

### Images

1. Read-only
2. Contain instructions (in a file called a "Dockerfile")
3. They do not actually "do" anything

### Containers

1. Modifyable (while running)
2. Can include files and programs (like your computer!)
3. Can run analyses or web applications (and more)


images are for Platonists, containers for nominalists.

Images are blueprints, containers are buildings

Also, containers (at least starting and stopping) are command-line

**TODO**: Anything the instructor should be aware of. Maybe here's a point for an 
image of some sorts.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge 

## Challenge 1: Images versus containers

You instructor introduced one analogy for explaining the difference between a 
Docker image and a Docker container. What is another way to explain images and 
containers?

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 

Several analogies exist, and here are a few:

- An image is a recipe, say, for your favorite curry, while the container is 
the actual curry dish you can eat.
- "Think of a container as a shipping container for software - it holds 
important content like files and programs so that an application can be 
delivered efficiently from producer to consumer. An image is more like a 
read-only manifest or schematic of what will be inside the container.""
(from [Jacob Schmitt](https://circleci.com/blog/docker-image-vs-container/))
- If you are familiar with object-oriented programming, you can think of an 
image as a class, and a container an object of that class.

## Retrieving images

**TODO** docker pull 

## Starting an image

**TODO** docker start

## Status check

**TODO** docker ps

## Using the container

**TODO** Do something in OpenRefine

## Stopping the container

**TODO** docker stop (after docker ps)

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge 

## Challenge 2: Checking the status of containers

We saw before that we could check the status of running containers by using the 
command `docker ps`. What happens when you run the same command now? What about
when you run the same command with the `-a` flag?

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 

- `docker ps` will show the status of all running containers. If you have no 
containers running, and you probably do not at this point of the lesson, you 
should see an empty table, like:
```
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND   CREATED   STATUS    PORTS     NAMES
$ 
```
- `docker ps -a` will show all containers that are running or _have been_ run 
on the machine. This includes the container that we stopped earlier.
```
$ docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                      COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS                       PORTS     NAMES
906072ff88f6   felixlohmeier/openrefine   "/app/refine -i 0.0.â€¦"   2 days ago      Exited (143) 2 days ago                determined_torvalds

$
```
Note the date information (in the `CREATED` and `STATUS` fields) and the 
container name (the `NAMES` field) will likely be different on your machine.

## Challenge 3: Order of operations

Rearrange the following commands to (in the following order) (1) start the 
OpenRefine container, (2) find the container image ID of the running OpenRefine 
container, and (3) terminal the OpenRefine container.

```
docker stop <container ID>
docker run -p 3333:3333 felixlohmeier/openrefine
docker ps
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 

```
docker run -p 3333:3333 felixlohmeier/openrefine
docker ps
docker stop <container ID>
```

## Figures

You can use standard markdown for static figures with the following syntax:

`![optional caption that appears below the figure](figure url){alt='alt text for
accessibility purposes'}`

![You belong in The Carpentries!](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carpentries/logo/master/Badge_Carpentries.svg){alt='Blue Carpentries hex person logo with no text.'}

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout

Callout sections can highlight information.

They are sometimes used to emphasise particularly important points
but are also used in some lessons to present "asides": 
content that is not central to the narrative of the lesson,
e.g. by providing the answer to a commonly-asked question.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


## Math

One of our episodes contains $\LaTeX$ equations when describing how to create
dynamic reports with {knitr}, so we now use mathjax to describe this:

`$\alpha = \dfrac{1}{(1 - \beta)^2}$` becomes: $\alpha = \dfrac{1}{(1 - \beta)^2}$

Cool, right?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- Use `.md` files for episodes when you want static content
- Use `.Rmd` files for episodes when you need to generate output
- Run `sandpaper::check_lesson()` to identify any issues with your lesson
- Run `sandpaper::build_lesson()` to preview your lesson locally
